      <p className="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
        This portfolio is more than a collection of projects — it’s a record of becoming. 
        From herding goats under South African skies to prototyping in a New York apartment, 
        every experience shaped how I see design: as care, critique, and storytelling. 
        I create to make systems gentler, interfaces kinder, and stories more human. 
        My work blends humor and heartbreak, logic and love — because that’s what life taught me design really is.
